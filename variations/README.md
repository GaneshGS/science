## Data Collection
The annotated spans by human and machine annotators as well as text renderings of the documents are
being released as a part of the Kira Systems collection (for non-commercial use). To gain access to the collection (in whole or part), researchers are required to fill out and submit [this](https://kirasystems.com/files/Kira-Systems-Information-Release-Application.pdf) agreement to `science at kirasystems dot com`. Upon receipt and successful processing of the executed agreement, researchers will be provided access to a download system that will enable them to retrieve the test collection. Specific instructions will be provided in the follow-up email. 

## Preliminaries
To run these scripts, you require a recent installation of Go (i.e., 1.11) that supports modules and/or are willing to put this repo in your go path. Once this is setup, you need to simply 
run `go build -o agree src/*.go` to generate an executable that you can use  with the commands outlined below to conduct the same analyses as in the paper.
